                    log4net has graduated from the Incubator project, however at the time 
                    the following releases were made, log4net was still undergoing incubation,
                    therefore these releases are <i>not</i> officially endorsed by the ASF.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Future releases of log4net will be officially endorsed by the ASF.
